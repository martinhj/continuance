								class="u-underline">a press release</a> and a
							letter sent directly to John Thune, the chairman of
							the US Senate commerce committee.</p>

		<p>Colin Stretch, general counsel at Facebook, said the company met
		with Thune on 18 May to discuss an internal two-week investigation,
		which had found “virtually identical” rates of approval of conservative
		and liberal topics.</p> <p>“Suppressing political content or preventing
		people from seeing what matters most to them is directly contrary to
		our mission and our business objectives, and the allegations troubled
		us deeply.”</p> <p>But Stretch said the investigation “could not fully
		exclude the possibility of isolated improper actions or unintentional
		bias” and Facebook would make changes to trending topics to prevent
		potential misuse and “to minimise risks where human judgment is
		involved”.</p> <p>The allegations, <a

		<p>Trending topics appear in the upper-right corner of the Facebook
		website, separate to the main news feed, and are said to be chosen to
		“help people discover current content that is both popular in the world
		and meaningful to them”.</p> <p>Topics are selected through a
		combination of algorithms and staff. In the letter to Thune, Facebook
		said: “We currently use people to bridge the gap between what an
		algorithm can do today and what we hope it will be able to do in the
		future.”</p> <p>The allegations of anti-conservative bias prompted
		Zuckerberg to <a

								conservative commentators</a> last
							Wednesday.</p> <p>The platform’s internal
							investigation spoke to current and former
							reviewers, current supervisors and “leading
							conservatives, to gain valuable feedback and
							insights”.</p> <p>Stretch said it found “no
							evidence of systematic political bias” in either
							the selection or prominence of stories included in
							the feature. “We were also unable to substantiate
							allegations of politically-motivated suppression of
							particular subjects or sources.”</p> <p>The letter
							to Thune went into more detail: topics relating to
							Republican political figures Ted Cruz, Rand Paul,
							Mitt Romney and Scott Walker – allegedly suppressed
							by reviewers because of political bias – were in
							fact accepted “on dozens of occasions”.</p> <p>“In
							fact, the two most frequently accepted topics since
							early 2015 are presumptive Republican presidential
							nominee Donald Trump and #GOPDebate,” the letter
							went on.</p> <p>Analysis of coverage of the late

		<p>Nonetheless, Facebook said its guidelines have been clarified and

		<p>Additional controls and oversight around the review team would also
